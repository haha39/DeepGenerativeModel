Use autoencoder to generate the following datasets for different latent dimensions.
+ mnist, latent dim=64, 32, 4
+ fashion mnist, latent dim=64, 32, 4

For each of the above case,
+ Calculate mean square error and L1 error for training and testing(you can choose any loss function).
+ Show 16 reconstructed image for 16 random images from training dataset as a 4x4 grid
+ Show 16 reconstructed image for 16 random images from testing dataset as a 4x4 grid

Submit your work in a single jupyter notebook, using tensorflow, pytorch.
